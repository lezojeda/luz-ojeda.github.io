An unexpected benefit of the **Y**ou **A**ren't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t principle I came upon while working in [Cook web](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/cook-web) is how much more motivated I felt when looking at concrete results earlier in the process. With other projects I created a whole complete CRUD API for a certain entity and only then I started a front end. This time I only created the DB, fed it some recipes, a Read endpoint with necessary query parameters to search, tests and that was it mainly. I then implemented a simple front end which let me start visualizing the product earlier, which motivated me to keep going and 4 months later I'm working on the CUD aspect of the API but with a basic project deployed and working in the web for everyone to see.
