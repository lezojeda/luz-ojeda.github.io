title: On loneliness II
---

From the post [about loneliness](/2023/11/16/on-loneliness.html) I am curious if what we are currently experiencing (an atomization of society with increasing levels of suffering due to loneliness) has precedents at some point of history or not. If it is a cyclical phenomenon that has already occurred other times. If anyone reading this knows for yes or no, I would love to [know more](/contact)
