  highlight: 'No me gusta el nombre chicharra: ojalá mantuvieran siempre el nombre cícadas, que se usa sólo cuando están en etapa ninfal. Si se llamaran cícadas, su ruido de verano me recordaría las flores violetas de los jacarandás en la costanera del Paraná o las mansiones de piedra blanca con sus escalinatas y sus sauces. Pero así, como chicharras, me recuerdan el calor, la carne podrida, los cortes de electricidad, a los borrachos que miran con ojos ensangrentados desde los bancos de la plaza.'

  highlight: "The price we pay to assume technology’s power is alienation. The toll can be particularly high with our intellectual technologies.

  highlight: Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand.

To keep a carriage waiting at the door of one party, so that on a moment’s notice it can whisk you away to another. To sidestep marriage in your youth and put off having children altogether. These are the greatest of conveniences, Anushka—and at one time, I had them all. But in the end, it has been the inconveniences that have mattered to me most."
