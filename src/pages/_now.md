# now

(this is a now page, [you could make one](https://nownownow.com/about) on your own website too.)

updated on January 10 2025, from my apartment in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

## working in
pretty excited to start working in [Compass](https://www.compass.com/) on August the 12th as a front end engineer ðŸ˜Œ

on June I started to contribute to [Cuentoneta](https://github.com/cuentoneta), an argentinean website dedicated to sharing and distribution of short stories mainly.

## studying
underestimating how burnt out I was from already going to college 7 years to get my degree in Biological Sciences, I stopped studying software engineering in UADE and started the OSSU curriculum back in May.

i'm working my way through the Systematic Program design: [How to Code Complex Data](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/coursepages/spd/README.md) from the Core Programming section of the curriculum.

since *How to Code Simple Data*, the first part of the Systematic Program Design course, I've been using Racket, a dialect of Lisp. This is my first time working with a pure functional programming language and it's been very interesting since I've mostly worked with Python, C# and JavaScript, mostly object-oriented general purpose languages.
