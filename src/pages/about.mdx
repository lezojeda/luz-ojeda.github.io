**Hello!** I'm Lucas, a {age} years old human from Buenos Aires, Argentina, South America.

## This website

It started with professional purposes but around September 2023 I started to expand it and has now become my little corner on the internet where I publish pictures, thoughts, rants, projects, what I'm reading, what I like, etc. And more in the future, probably. I like to think of it more as a _[digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/)_ instead of a static website where I just publish posts and nothing else. Even this section will be updated many more times in the future, until I get bored for a while and then come back at it again. My interests change, as do the interests of many people.

## Writing

Although I've enjoyed writing since I was a teenager, it has always been in a private journal. In physical notebooks, notes on my cellphone, a WhatsApp conversation with myself, Google Docs, etc. Lately, I became motivated enough from [reading](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write) [some](https://moretothat.com/writing-and-wisdom/) [articles](https://whiona.weblog.lol/2023/10/what-happened-to-blogging-for-the-hell-of-it) out there among other personal things to write and _publish_ more. It helps me. In many ways. Such as understanding better the things I write about, reflecting, gathering my thoughts, improving my english writing skills, etc. And I hope in the future some people will enjoy reading what I write as well.

Sometimes I write posts in my native language (spanish) first and then translate them (with DeepL or Google Translate and manual adjustments afterwards, not going to lie here). Some other times I write english first. Just a disclaimer in case that you find any "weird" sounding sentence that it may be because it was probably written spanish first.

## What I do

I studied Biology in Buenos Aires University (UBA) from 2011 to 2019, when I graduated. Then did a career switch to web developing in 2019, which is my current full-time job. I started studying software engineering in August 2023.

### Interests

-   **[Reading](/reading)**: Non-fiction essays about modern stuff, history, classics, science fiction, fantasy, etc. Would love to read more horror/suspense. But I love reading _anything_. Been browsing lots of blogs and personal webpages in the last few months.
-   **Hiking**, although I live ~500km from the nearest interesting hiking spot it is something I love every time I have the opportunity to get close to the Andes mountains or the CÃ³rdoba Sierras (mountains of a lower altitude).
-   **Running**. Long distance-ish. Although I come and go, I really enjoy when I can go beyond 8km. Most I've ran is 13km. Always with music on.
-   **Videogames**: Fallout New Vegas, Age of Empires, Kerbal Space Program and Hollow Knight are some games I've loved the most. I keep a [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/synthopia/) too.
-   **Cooking and baking**
-   **Driving** (no matter where, but _not_ in the city though)
-   Electronic music [in general](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5b63esqqeHwZTCTkAFG0VA?si=a1370cce90044fe3) (techno, progressive house, melodic techno), 80s classics, EDM, progressive rock, alternative, and others. Can't have enough playlists.
-   Plants. Although I live in an apartment, I care for many plants and would love to have a garden some day to grow my own food and flowers.
