After almost going mad trying to figure out why some pages of this website were slightly displaced to the left, I found out much to my embarrassment, that it was due to the scroll bar in some of them. Following this discovery, I found out about the [scrollbar-gutter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter) CSS property.

Good lord, thank you. Coding in the nights after a full time job sometimes it's too exhausting.

Scrollbars take up width, who would've thought.
