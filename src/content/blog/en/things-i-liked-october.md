- [Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music](https://ishkur.kenxaj.cyou/): nice 1.0 Web-style graphical representation of the different electronic music genres with example tracks for each one
- [How I Read](https://sirupsen.com/read) by Simon Hørup Eskildsen
    - A nice 4 step (sourcing, choosing, reading and processing) detailed process on how to improve which books to read and how to retain more about what we read. Convinced me to give [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) a try since I like to highlight books and would like to revisit them after finishing them.
- [What happened to blogging for the hell of it?](https://whiona.weblog.lol/2023/10/what-happened-to-blogging-for-the-hell-of-it)
    - Which in turn led me to [32bit cafe](https://32bit.cafe), a really cool community of websites hobbyists.
    - Related as well: [More people should write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write)
- [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) by Eric Steven Raymond
- [The Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect): "If it was relevant for the last 100 years it will probably will be relevant for the next 100". An interesting theorized phenomenon to consider, for example, when choosing a book to read or a movie to watch (some classics are still relevant for good reasons)
- This YouTube video: [The Cult of Productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTMTZ7PAMYE)
    - Stop obsessing over productivity, optimization and spend time _doing_
- [Write for Yourself, and Wisdom Will Follow](https://moretothat.com/writing-and-wisdom/)
    - My personal takeaway: dedicate deliberate time to writing in order to gather and organize your thoughts from the daily and routinely activities. The reflection that comes from writing lets us structure our thoughts, what we learn and generate wisdom that gives us new and better insights.
- [Death to Bullshit](https://deathtobullshit.com/): Because “people's capacity for bullshit is rapidly diminishing”.
    - Don't miss the "Turn bullshit on?" button to the top-right section of the page.
- [The Cult of Done Manifesto](https://designmanifestos.org/bre-pettis-and-kio-stark-2009-the-cult-of-done-manifesto/)
    - A gold nugget on getting things done, avoid perfection, failing, everything is a draft, etc.
