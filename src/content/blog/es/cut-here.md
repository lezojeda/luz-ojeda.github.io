It's so hard to think "It ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance"
Because it's hard to think
"I'll never get another chance
To hold you to hold you"

But chilly Mr Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later

I should've stopped to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over, over
And you're gone

**I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much**

But how how many times can I walk away and wish "If only"
But how many times can I talk this way and wish "If only"
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish "If only"

But "If only"
Is a wish too late
