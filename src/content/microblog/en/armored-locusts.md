Today I learned:

[Revelation 9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209-10) from the New Testament:

“_The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months_”

Learnt about this from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPvJ-M-hU5w)
