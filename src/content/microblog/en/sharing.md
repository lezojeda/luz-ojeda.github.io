A non-negative cause of compulsive social media use is the need to share. Music, movies, memes, something we saw on the street or an event in our lives. I say non-negative because it is a fundamental aspect of each person's life. But, in an increasingly atomized society where loneliness is growing abundant, sometimes we have no one to share things with _in person_.
