"Staying in" today can mean so many different things compared to decades ago, with an increasingly virtual world that caters to every taste and desire.

I come to think about how different it is now, when staying home can mean exploring entire worlds through screens, from games to documentaries, books, encyclopedias, forums, social networks, endless videos of all kinds, etc.

There’s a kind of richness to it that didn’t exist before (which won't stop growing unless the apocalypse comes), but also a quiet distance that comes with replacing physical presence with digital experience.
