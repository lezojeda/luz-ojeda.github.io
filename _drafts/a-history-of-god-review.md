title: "A History of God: Book Review"
---

I am an atheist since my adolescence. Can't recall exactly when I stopped believing in the christian God. I was baptised as a baby since my family was catholic (as most Argentinean christians are) although my grandparents where the real practicioners and insisted on baptism. My parents are believers but, from speaking to them about these topics throughout the years, they aren't ardent catholics. They tend to believe that there is/must be "something more" but they never read the whole bible nor they went to church periodically.

As an always curious person around September I looked up some recommendations on books about God and religion in general in Reddit. Can't remember why exactly. But I saw A History of God recommended several times which led me to add it to my to-read list and it was a very worthwhile and interesting read really.

As I read the first half which chronologically studies and tells the story of the god of judaism, then christianism and finally islam I realized how I had a very simplistic picture of the concept of God. From several "popular" depictions of him as a bearded relatively old man in the skies (such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam), I suppose.
