Is there a correlation between love for minimalist design and the sensivity of those who love it? I mean, with a higher degree of sensibility you may be more prone to dislike too many stimuli. Whether these are auditive, visual, tactile, etc. 

I consider myself a very sensitive persone. Since I had a considerable degree of consciousnes I am aware of this. And in the last years I've found myself more and more drawn to a more minimalist design (not to the extreme really, especially not inm y home). Hence this webpage design.
