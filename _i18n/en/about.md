<!-- **Hi there**, I am a 29 years old web developer from **Buenos Aires (Argentina)** working in [**{{site.current_company}}**]({{site.current_company_url}}) since January, 2023.

I have mainly studied web development during 2019 at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), among other resources such as related channels in YouTube (like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) which I recommend a lot), the Mozilla Developer Network and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) which led me to work on several small projects present on my [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/luz-ojeda). In August 2023 I've started the career of Software Engineering in UADE (Universidad Argentina de la Empresa).

I have also studied and graduated in Biology at the *Universidad de Buenos Aires* from 2011 to 2019 including a final lab thesis where I studied plant physiology. It was during one of my Statistics courses that I started programming with R which later led to my interest in web development and career shift.

What else do I do besides coding? I enjoy [reading](/reading), particularly sci-fi, history, and non-fiction essays ([my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116528903?ref=nav_profile_l)). I also like to hit the hiking trails whenever I can travel to the mountains or go for a run in my neighborhood and spend some time playing video games on my PC as well. If you are on Steam, feel free to add me 66021605.

**Hi there**, I am Luz, another 29 years old human from **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

This website started with professional purposes but around september 2023 I started to expand it and it has now become my little corner in the internet where I publish pictures, thoughts, rants, projects, what I'm reading, what I like, etc. Although I've enjoyed writing since a teenager, it was always in a private journal. Notebooks, notes in my cellphone, Google Docs, etc.

But lately, I became motivated enough from [reading](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write) [some](https://moretothat.com/writing-and-wisdom/) [articles](https://blog.whiona.me/what-happened-to-blogging-for-the-hell-of-it/) out there among other personal things to write and publish more. It helps me. In many ways. Such as understanding the things I write about better, reflecting, gathering my thoughts, improving my english writing skills, etc. And I hope in the future some people enjoy reading my content as too. 

Sometimes I write posts in my native language (spanish) first and then translate them (with DeepL or Google Translate and manual adjustments afterwards, not going to lie here) and some others english first. Just a disclaimer in case that you find any "weird" sounding sentence that it may be because it was probably written spanish first.

I studied Biology from 2011 to 2019, when I graduated. Then did a career switch to web developing in 2019, which is my current full-time job and started studying software engineering in 2023.

Interests.

- [Reading](/reading): Books of non-fiction essays about modern stuff, history, classics, science fiction, fantasy, etc. Would love to read more horror/suspense. I have a [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116528903?ref=nav_profile_l) profile too. But I love reading _anything_. Been browsing lots of blogs and personal webpages in the last few months.
- Hiking, although I live ~500km from the nearest interesting hiking spot it is something I love every time I have the opportunity to get close to the Andes mountains or the CÃ³rdoba Sierras (mountains of a lower altitude).
- Running
- Videogames: Been too busy with work, university, exercise and some other things but I enjoy PC gaming as well. Fallout New Vegas, Age of Empires, Kerbal Space Program and Hollow Knight are some of my must beloved games I've played. I keep a [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/synthopia/) too.
- Cooking and baking
- Driving (no matter where, but _not_ in the city though)
- Electronic music [in general](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5b63esqqeHwZTCTkAFG0VA?si=a1370cce90044fe3) (techno, progressive house, melodic techno), 80s classics, EDM, progressive rock, alternative, and others. Can't have enough playlists.
