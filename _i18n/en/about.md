Hi there, I am a 29 years old web developer from Buenos Aires (Argentina) working in [{{site.current_company}}]({{site.current_company_url}}) since January, 2023.

I have mainly studied web development during 2019 at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), among other resources such as related channels in YouTube (like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) which I recommend a lot), the Mozilla Developer Network and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) which led me to work on several small projects visible on my [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/lezojeda).

Nowadays I am interested in improving my back-end skills so I have been studying in the [**Back-End Engineer Career Path**](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/back-end-engineer) in Codecademy in my spare time. Along with working on some projects like this site itself (built with Jekyll), a [personal budget API](https://github.com/lezojeda/personal-budget) (for the Codecademy course along with a simple frontend associated) and a book reading tracking webapp. See more in the [projects](/projects) section.

I am also a former biologist from the *Universidad de Buenos Aires* where I studied from 2011 to 2019 including a final lab thesis where I studied plant physiology. In one of my Statistic courses is where I started programming with R which later led to my interest in web development and the career shift.

Besides coding I also have a few hobbies and interests that keep me busy. I enjoy [reading](/reading), particularly sci-fi, history, and non-fiction essays. I also like to hit the hiking trails or spend some time playing video games on my PC. If you are on Steam, feel free to add me 66021605. I also try to stay active by running and going to the gym.
