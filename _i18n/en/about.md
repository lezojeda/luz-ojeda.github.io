Hi there, I am a 29 years old web developer from Buenos Aires (Argentina) working in [{{site.current_company}}]({{site.current_company_url}}) since January, 2023.

I have mainly studied full stack web development during 2019 at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), among other resources such as related channels in YouTube (like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) which I recommend a lot), the Mozilla Developer Network and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) which led me to work on several small projects visible on my [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/lezojeda).

Nowadays I am interested in improving my back-end skills so I have been studying in the [**Back-End Engineer Career Path**](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/back-end-engineer) in Codecademy in my spare time. Along with working on some projects like this site itself (built with Jekyll), a personal budget webapp (for the Codecademy course) and a book reading tracking webapp. See more in the [projects](/projects) section.

I am also a former biologist from the *Universidad de Buenos Aires* where I studied from 2011 to 2019 including a final lab thesis where I studied plant physiology.

Among my interests are [reading](/reading) (sci-fi and non-fiction essays mostly), hiking, videogames (ofc, right?) and running/gym.
