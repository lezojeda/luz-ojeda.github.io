**Hi there**, I am a 29 years old web developer from **Buenos Aires (Argentina)** working in [**{{site.current_company}}**]({{site.current_company_url}}) since January, 2023.

I have mainly studied web development during 2019 at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), among other resources such as related channels in YouTube (like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) which I recommend a lot), the Mozilla Developer Network and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) which led me to work on several small projects present on my [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/luz-ojeda). In august 2023 I've started the career of Software Engineering in UADE (Universidad Argentina de la Empresa).

I have also studied Biology in the *Universidad de Buenos Aires* from 2011 to 2019 including a final lab thesis where I studied plant physiology. In one of my Statistic courses is where I started programming with R which later led to my interest in web development and the career shift.

What else do I do besides coding? I enjoy [reading](/reading), particularly sci-fi, history, and non-fiction essays ([my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116528903?ref=nav_profile_l)). I also like to hit the hiking trails whenever I can travel to the mountains or go for a run in my neighborhood and spend some time playing video games on my PC as well. If you are on Steam, feel free to add me 66021605.
