Hi there, my name is Luz Ojeda, I am a 29 years old web developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am currently working in
[{{site.current_company}}]({{site.current_company_url}}) since January, 2023.

I've mainly studied full stack web development at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), among other resources such as YouTube, the Mozilla Developer Network which led me to work on several small projects visible on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/lezojeda).
