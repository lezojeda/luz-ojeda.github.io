<!-- **Hi there**, I am a 29 years old web developer from **Buenos Aires (Argentina)** working in [**{{site.current_company}}**]({{site.current_company_url}}) since January, 2023.

I have mainly studied web development during 2019 at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), among other resources such as related channels in YouTube (like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) which I recommend a lot), the Mozilla Developer Network and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) which led me to work on several small projects present on my [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/luz-ojeda). In August 2023 I've started the career of Software Engineering in UADE (Universidad Argentina de la Empresa).

I have also studied and graduated in Biology at the *Universidad de Buenos Aires* from 2011 to 2019 including a final lab thesis where I studied plant physiology. It was during one of my Statistics courses that I started programming with R which later led to my interest in web development and career shift.

What else do I do besides coding? I enjoy [reading](/reading), particularly sci-fi, history, and non-fiction essays ([my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116528903?ref=nav_profile_l)). I also like to hit the hiking trails whenever I can travel to the mountains or go for a run in my neighborhood and spend some time playing video games on my PC as well.

**Hi there**, I am Luz, another 29 years old human from **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

I originally started this website with professional purposes but since its first commit in february 2023 I started expanding it to make it my little corner in the internet where I publish pictures, thoughts, rants, projects, what I'm reading, what I like, etc.

I've kept a physical and then digital private journal for 6 years already and have always enjoyed writing although never very consistently (not that it should be more or less consistent since it was just for me).

I studied Biology from 2011 to 2019, did a career switch to web developing in 2019 and started studying software engineering in 2023. During one of my statistics course in Biology is that I started programming with R which then later led me to pick up HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Besides coding I like to [read](/reading), hike (whenever I can travel to the mountains), run, play videogames (RTS, simulators and shooters), cook and lately write and publish (since I keep a private journal since 2017 and always enjoyed writing here and there)
