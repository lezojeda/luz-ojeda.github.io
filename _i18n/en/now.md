Updated on December 2023, from my apartment in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

Closing the year. I finished the semester passing the 3 subjects I signed up for, feeling a little saturated and with very little time.

## working in
Nothing until January. A short break at the same time as my company's "recharge" week (where no one works from December 24 to January 2) as well as finishing college, having worked a lot on this page and already being satisfied with it.

My plan is to start a new web app in January to which I want to dedicate all of 2024, without rushing, with the aim of deploying it to a productive environment with its own domain.

## exercise
I exchanged running for the gym, which I go to 3 times a week for a month and ten days already. I felt more like lifting weights and ending up more exhausted than running. I miss running already a little now, tho.

## [reading](/reading)
Right now [On Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing) by Stephen King.

And I also read [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) and [Hell Yeah or No](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show /52523856-hell-yeah-or-no)
