(This is a now page, [you could make one](https://nownownow.com/about) on your own website too.)

Updated october 28, 2023, from my home in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

## working on (besides my full time job)
This website. A lot. In the last month I added the [pictures](/pictures) section which led me to create two Python scripts for the pipeline of: 1. Generating two pictures from the one I want to upload (one for mobile/table another one for big screens) and 2. Creating the corresponding markdown file used in the pictures folder collection. 

Maybe I will try to automate the whole thing after adding the file in the project assets folder. 

I updated the reading and resume sections as well as some general design/styling features.

## exercise
Running two times a week, came back to it in august. I really needed to start working out again and it's doing wonders.

## [reading](/reading)
A Tale of Two Cities

## studying
Finishing my first term of software engineering in college. Started with computer architecture, information systems and a the first course on programming (of a total of 4). First time studying with a full time job because during my Biology studies I didn't work or worked part time. Very tiring, but rewarding of course.

## other
I am cooking a lot of new recipes from the book [The Food Lab](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science). Gave it a broad read and, for the last month, focused mainly on the first chapter.
