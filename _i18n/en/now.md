## working in
A cooking web app in Svelte/C#. Finished the simple CRUD API with recipes I found in a db out there in the internet. Parsed them with Python scripts obtaining the necessary information. Now I am working in the front end, sketching the designs with Figma and implementing them with SvelteKit.
