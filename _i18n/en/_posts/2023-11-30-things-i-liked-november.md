title: Things I liked in November
---

- [Object-Oriented Programming is Bad](https://m.youtube.com/watch?si=H7BOm06UbdgiU0et&v=QM1iUe6IofM&feature=youtu.be)
    - A bit of a click-baity title since the author then uploaded [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iyB0_qPvWk&list=WL&index=5) arguing in favour of OOP, but well used. This video criticizes OOP from a point of view I haven't heard/read before and gives very nice takeaways on how to tackle its problems.
- [Code is run more than read](https://olano.dev/2023-11-30-code-is-run-more-than-read/)
- [The Lack of Compensation in Open Source Software is Unsustainable](https://trstringer.com/oss-compensation-broken/)
- [Don’t Forget to Swim Now and Then](https://www.raptitude.com/2023/07/dont-forget-to-swim-now-and-then/)
- [Why Tacit Knowledge is More Important Than Deliberate Practice](https://commoncog.com/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/)
    - Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone.
- [Why I have a homepage](https://flamedfury.com/manifesto/#why-i-have-a-homepage)
- [cabbage sorter](https://cabbagesorter.neocities.org/)
    - Loved the old style web vibes of this website
- [Writing one sentence per line](https://sive.rs/1s)
    - Put into practice this advice lately and it has done wonders. Helps you avoid unnecessary long lines and write clearer.
- [The IndieWeb for Everyone](https://mxb.dev/blog/the-indieweb-for-everyone/)
    - “The more independence a technology gives you, the higher its barrier for adoption.” But for now, and it shouldn't be this way as the author argues.
