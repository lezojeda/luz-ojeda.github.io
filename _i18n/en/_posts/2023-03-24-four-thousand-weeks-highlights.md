title: Highlights from the book Four Thousand Weeks
---

I fell into the productivity rabbit hole for some years where I tried lots and lots of tools to try to make the best use of every day and single hour of my life. Today I just use Google Calendar and a physical [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) for organization and I think it'd be best if I'd done it before. Specially the "physical" aspect of it. Working as a developer, enjoying videogames and reading in a Kindle among other activies I end up spending much of my day in front of screens (just like many others, I know) so taking a break and writing on paper is very enjoyable.

I came across [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks) last year around September and can say it was one of the few books that really improved my life. The title is a reference to, in average, the amount of weeks we get in our lives. The author argues that the problem doesn't lie in how we organize our time every day, instead we should reevaluate our relationship with time itself, considering our mortality. Even if we fully optimize our life and achieve more things in a day, the list of things-to-do is practically _infinite_. So there is no way to truly "win".

So without further ado, these are some of my highlights:

(About techniques and products to optimize time and increase productivity)

❝*The problem isn’t exactly that these techniques and products don’t work. It’s that they do work—in the sense that you’ll get more done, race to more meetings, ferry your kids to more after-school activities, generate more profit for your employer—and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious, and somehow emptier as a result.*❞

❝*The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control—when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do lists have stopped getting longer; when you’re meeting all your obligations at work and in your home life; when nobody’s angry with you for missing a deadline or dropping the ball; and when the fully optimized person you’ve become can turn, at long last, to the things life is really supposed to be about.*❞

❝*The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it’s impossible ever to feel as though you’re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time—instead of just being time, you might say—it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally “out of the way.*❞

❝*Convenience culture seduces us into imagining that we might find room for everything important by eliminating only life’s tedious tasks. But it’s a lie. You have to choose a few things, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable sense of loss that results.*❞

❝*Yet it’s surely no coincidence that hobbies have acquired this embarrassing reputation in an era so committed to using time instrumentally. In an age of instrumentalization, the hobbyist is a subversive: he insists that some things are worth doing for themselves alone, despite offering no payoffs in terms of productivity or profit.*❞

❝*The point, to be clear, isn’t that freelancing or long-term travel—let alone family-friendly workplace policies—are intrinsically bad things. **It’s that they come with an unavoidable flip side: every gain in personal temporal freedom entails a corresponding loss in how easy it is to coordinate your time with other people’s**.*❞

❝*A life spent focused on achieving security with respect to time, when in fact such security is unattainable, can only ever end up feeling provisional—as if the point of your having been born still lies in the future, just over the horizon, and your life in all its fullness can begin as soon as you’ve gotten it.*❞
