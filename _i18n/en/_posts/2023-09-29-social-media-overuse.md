title: Social media overuse
---

The days when I end up overusing social media (in all its shapes and forms like Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) I end up feeling saturated and drained. It's like being in a really crowded room with a mix of people you don't know, some you kind of know, and a few close friends. Everyone is talking loudly, some are even yelling, and there's the occasional name-calling fighting and arguing (myself included many times, won't play fool here).

It doesn't scratches the itch of my daily social need so I end up exhausted but still needing some real face-to-face interaction. Communicating with just written words (without tone and body language) doesn't even compare to face to face communication which includes both three.

I may be irremediably nostalgic but everyday I miss times before constant communication and social media apps.
